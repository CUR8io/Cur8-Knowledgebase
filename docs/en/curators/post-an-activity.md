1. **Understand Your Audience**: What are their pain points, desires, and interests? Tailor your headline and post description to resonate with their needs and preferences.

3. **Be Clear and Specific**: Offer concrete benefits or solutions that your audience can expect from reading your post.
4. **Create a Sense of Urgency**: Instill a sense of urgency or FOMO in your headline to prompt immediate action â€“ this is great for promoting mint discounts, new drops and contests!
5. **Pose Thought-Provoking Questions**: Ask thought-provoking questions to stimulate curiosity and encourage readers to seek answers within your post.
6. **Keep it Short and Concise**: Shorter headlines tend to be more impactful and easier to digest.
7. **Use Different Headline Formats**: Lists, how-tos, or controversial statements all work to help capture attention.
8. **Use Accurate Subject Tags**: Ensure your audience has a very clear idea of what you're posting about.
9. **Create Rich Conten**t: Make use of the rich-text editor to add headings, embed useful links and sprinkle your posts with some personality.

Curators that post daily build stronger connections with their audience â€“ start getting creative and engage collectors and potential new supporters of your curations!
