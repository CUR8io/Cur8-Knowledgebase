These Terms of Use (“Terms”) describe the rules for visitors of this platform, our website at  [cur8.io](https://cur8.io/) (“Platform”) and our related websites, as well as users of applications or any other software, tools, features or functionalities in connection with our services thereon (collectively, the “Service”), including their accessing, downloading or using of any component of the Service and their using, sending or receiving tokens or otherwise transacting with any component of the Service, which we may update from time to time at our sole discretion. Reference to “NFT” in these Terms means a non-fungible token or similar digital item implemented on a blockchain (such as the Ethereum blockchain), which uses smart contracts to link to or otherwise be associated with certain content or data.

These Terms constitute a legally binding and enforceable agreement between you and Cur8 Limited (Company Registration No. 233662), a company incorporated in the Republic of Seychelles and having its registered address at Suite 309, Capital City Building, Independence Avenue, Victoria, Mahe, Republic of Seychelles, its affiliates and subsidiaries (collectively, “Company”, “we”, “our” or “us”).

If you are using the Service on behalf of a company or entity, you represent and warrant that (a) you have authority to bind that entity to the Terms; and (b) by accepting the Terms, you are doing so on behalf of that entity, and all reference to “you” in the Terms shall accordingly be construed to include you and that entity.&#x20;

#### _Assumption of Risk_

The prices and value of NFTs may fluctuate significantly and you accept and acknowledge all risks associated with discovering, managing, and displaying the NFTs on the Service, including the following:

* The value of NFTs and other digital assets may be subject to dramatic fluctuations and may be highly volatile.  As relatively new products and technologies, blockchain-based assets are not widely accepted or recognised modes of payments for goods and services and fluctuations in the price of cryptocurrency can also materially and adversely affect NFT prices. Therefore, the market value of any NFTs and other digital assets may fall below the price at which you acquire them. You acknowledge that you fully understand this subjectivity and volatility and that you may lose money.
* Much of the demand for NFTs and blockchain-based assets is generated by speculators and investors who want to profit from short or long-term holding of blockchain assets. A lack of use or public interest in the creation and development of decentralized ecosystems could negatively impact the development of those ecosystems and related applications, which could, in return, negatively impact the potential utility of NFTs.
* The regulatory regime governing blockchain technologies, NFTs, cryptocurrency, and other crypto-based items and digital assets is uncertain, and new regulations or policies may adversely affect the development of the Service, which could impede or limit your ability to continue the use and enjoyment of such assets and the NFTs.
* You are solely responsible for assessing what, if any, taxes apply to your transactions on the Service, and to withhold, collect, report, and remit the correct amounts of taxes to the tax authorities. We are not responsible for determining, withholding, collecting, reporting, or remitting the taxes that apply to your NFTs.
* The Service, Company or your NFTs may be the target of third-party attacks, including but not limited to phishing, brute forcing, inactive listing exploits or the use of viruses. We are not responsible or liable, directly or indirectly, for any actual or alleged loss or damage that you may sustain in such event(s). There are also risks associated with purchasing items associated with content created by third parties through peer-to-peer transactions, including, the risk of purchasing counterfeit items, mislabelled items, items on smart contracts with bugs, and items that may become untransferable. It is your responsibility to do your research before making any decisions to sell, obtain, transfer, or otherwise interact with any NFTs or accounts/collections.
* We do not control the blockchains that you are interacting with and certain smart contracts and protocols that may be integral to complete transactions on these blockchains. You acknowledge and agree that such technologies are novel, experimental, and speculative, and accordingly, there is significant uncertainty regarding the operation and effects and risks thereof and the application of existing law thereto. To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, the Company disclaims any and all liability related to the foregoing. In addition, blockchain transactions are irreversible and the Company has no ability to reverse any transactions on the blockchain, except as otherwise provided for herein.&#x20;
* There are risks associated with using Internet and blockchain-based products. This includes the risk associated with hardware, software, and Internet connections, the risk of malicious software introduction, and the risk that third parties may obtain unauthorized access to your third-party wallet or account. We are not responsible for any communication failures, disruptions, errors, distortions or delays you may experience when using the Service or any blockchain, howsoever caused.
* If you have a dispute with one or more users, YOU RELEASE US FROM CLAIMS, DEMANDS, AND DAMAGES OF EVERY KIND AND NATURE, KNOWN AND UNKNOWN, ARISING OUT OF OR IN ANY WAY CONNECTED WITH SUCH DISPUTES.
