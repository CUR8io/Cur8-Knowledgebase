<summary>What is the level of quality maintained of the assets that are pulled into CUR8 and in the galleries specifically?</summary>

CUR8 tries to optimize image quality and file size based on screen size. For larger screens, we try to access the highest quality image available. However, due to issues with IPFS and content delivery networks, sometimes we are unable to quickly load the files and will revert back to the largest size image we have access to.

<details>

<summary>What security protocols are followed for wallet connections with CUR8? </summary>

CUR8 only connects with wallets to prove that our users actually control their wallets and do not submit transactions to the blockchain. Additionally, we allow users to Link wallets right after connecting which then allows them to always browse their wallet contents without ever needing to reconnect ever again. We do not interact with any smart contracts on CUR8 and only link out to reputable external marketplaces right now. We also suggest using a smaller wallet to test out our services first if you require additional precautions or have any concerns.

### Collectors

<details>

<summary>Not all assets in my linked wallet/s are displaying in CUR8. What is the reason for this?</summary>

There may be a number of reasons why some assets are not displaying within CUR8:

1. The token data API provider CUR8 uses attributes spam scores to certain NFTs that are airdropped or malicious in nature and will thus not be displayed.
2. New NFTs that are collected may take some time to be displayed in CUR8. You can try to sync new assets to CUR8 by clicking on the sync button next to 'Connect.'

### Creators

<details>

<summary>I have collections that are currently minting, why am I unable to verify these collections on CUR8?</summary>

The token data API that CUR8 uses does not recognize collections where there have been 0 mints to date.

If this is not the case and you are still having issues verifying your collections, [**please DM us on X**](https://x.com/Cur8Labs) so we can help check.

</details>

<details>

<summary>Can I hide burned pieces in my collection that are displaying on my Creator Profile?</summary>

Yes, you can hide burned pieces and even feature some that you want collectors to see on your profile. [**Learn more about this here.**](../creators/feature-pieces.md)

</details>

<details>

<summary>I have pieces that are a part of an Open/Collaborative collection. Can I add these to my portfolio?</summary>

Currently this is not possible with CUR8. It is best practice to always mint your work in collections that you create. This helps our team verify that you are the owner of the collection, and gives you greater control of what is added to your collection.
