# ðŸ’° Wallets

Linking your wallet/s to CUR8 pulls in all of your NFTs held in your wallet/s into the platform without having to connect every time you log in. This allows for you to save any galleries you create of your collections.

### Link Your Wallet



1. Hover over the Connect wallet button at the top right-hand side of the screen, and select the blockchain use wish to connect a wallet from.
