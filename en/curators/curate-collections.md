CUR8 empowers curators to easily discover and feature collections from top creators across multiple genres and blockchains in one place!&#x20;

### Curating Collections

There are a couple of ways for curators to discover art and curate collections to feature on their profile:

Once you've curated a couple of collections, head back to your CUR8 curator profile to view them. Your profile will be populated with the key activities and updates from creators you have curated so you never miss a drop.
