# ▶️ Digital Ownership Made Simple

Creators across industries—artists, musicians, writers—are underpaid and disconnected from their fans. Platforms like galleries, publishers, and streaming services dominate distribution and revenue, leaving creators with a fraction of their worth. Take Snoop Dogg, a globally recognized Hip-Hop icon that earned less than $45,000 for a billion Spotify streams.&#x20;

This systemic issue spans all creative fields, undervaluing creators and depriving fans of meaningful connections, and one that CUR8 aims to solve.
